                    <p>Dockmate® has proprietary DockControl software with highly-customizable settings that allows the
                        owners to put their “personal touch” on how the TWIST 3-axis joystick feels and reacts.
                        The smooth, variable-speed, fully-proportional thruster and throttle control was also something
                        which was ONLY OFFERED with Dockmate® and has never been available with competitive products.
                        Since the launch of Dockmate® US in 2018, the media coverage for the product has been nothing
                        short
                        of amazing and Dockmate® is the fastest growing wireless remote control for boats!
                        Dockmate® has formed solid relationships with industry-leading companies such as Glendinning and
                        VETUS who allow Dockmate® to connect DIRECTLY into their CAN bus network. This was NEVER allowed
                        by
                        any other wireless remote control company until Dockmate®
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dockmate®, VETUS and Glendinning have shared a demo boat that traveled to many boats shows and
                        it
                        gave owners the opportunity to “try before they buy” even though Dockmate® offers a 30 day
                        satisfaction, money back guarantee. Trusted by the leading brands of thrusters and electronics
                        controls, advanced technology, customizable software, and fail-safe technology give Dockmate®
                        the
                        successful ingredients for the wireless remote control system of the future.</p>
