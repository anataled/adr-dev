                <p>The Aquadrive antivibration system will help you and your crew enjoy the peace and quiet of boating.
                    By isolating the engine from the rest of your boat, noise and vibration are greatly reduced. Most
                    installations result in a 50% or more reduction in cabin or cockpit noise and vibration. Aquadrive
                    will also help to keep your driveline in good condition by minimizing wear and tear on the
                    transmission and cutlass bearings. The propeller shaft is aligned to an Aquadrive thrust bearing,
                    which absorbs the propeller thrust. A Constant Velocity (CV) shaft transmits engine power to the
                    thrust bearing and propeller shaft. The CV shaft automatically adjusts to changes in the alignment
                    between engine and thrust bearing and allows engine movements in every direction. Unlike standard
                    installations, periodic realignment will not be required. The use of softer engine mounts, which
                    isolate engine vibration from the hull, completes the system. Aquadrive antivibration system creates
                    the necessary conditions for a smooth running, quiet boat.</p>
