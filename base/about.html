                <p class="leading-8">
                    ADR Power Systems, Inc. was founded by David Arata and Richard DeBord in October of 2015. Operations
                    began in a small warehouse near the Channel District in Tampa, Florida, and focused on marine
                    transmission services for recreational and commercial fishing vessels ranging from small boats to
                    mega yachts. Expert workmanship, coupled with rapid turn-around time, catapulted the company to
                    broaden its presence to include the Gulf States, Great Lakes Region, Eastern Seabord and the
                    Caribbean.
